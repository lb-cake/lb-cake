###  Howdy 🤠

### I have about 6 years of professional experience doing software development for Government and Financial Institutions. I have a passion for removing manual processes, and making developers lives easier.

Somethings I want to explore in my career are DevOps, and helping build the tools enterprise infrastructure relies on!

This year, some of my goals are...

- ✅ Learn Basics of Kubernetes
- ✅ Achieve AWS Solutions Architect Associate
- 📣 Become more social!
- 🐹 Learn Golang

###  Howdy ðŸ¤ 

### I have about 6 years of professional experience doing software development for Government and Financial Institutions. I have a passion for removing manual processes, and making developers lives easier.

Somethings I want to explore in my career are DevOps, and helping build the tools enterprise infrastructure relies on!

This year, some of my goals are...

- âœ… Learn Basics of Kubernetes
- âœ… Achieve AWS Solutions Architect Associate
- ðŸ“£ Become more social!
